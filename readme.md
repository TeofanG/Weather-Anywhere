Weather Anywhere is a web application built in Html5, CSS and Vanilla Javascript that allows users view the current weather in a specific location. 


List with the implemented functionalities:

- viewing weather information in any location (temperature, humidity, wind speed etc.);
- adding a location to favorite;
- specific themes and designs depending on time of the day and weather status (day/night, rain, snow etc.)

Images, icons and other media assets are not owned by me and were imported from open-sources. (ex: https://favicon.io/)

Run the app following the next steps(node.js is required in order to run the local host server):

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory
2. Run "live-server" command (it should open the app, if not go to "http://localhost:8080/")
